<h1>SEPP</h1>

<h1>Scripture Electronic Publishing Package</h1>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Sepp is a program, still very much under development, to
facilitate the electronic publishing of Scripture. It can be used to
convert sources in XHTML, HTML, OSIS, USFM, or OurWord format into a
set of HTML files which can be used to browse the Scriptures directly
or to study them by means of a concordance. Footnotes and
cross-references are supported, and where the destination of a
cross-reference exists in the site a hot link is created.</p>

<p>In conjunction with ConcStartup, a simple program that can be
invoked automatically when a CD is inserted, a set of HTML files
produced by Sepp can be placed on a CD which, when inserted, will
display a startup screen offering to run the concordance from CD,
install a suitable browser, install preferred fonts, or install the
complete package onto the computer and create shortcuts.</p>

<p class="enhancement">Sepp is still very much under
development. At many points through this documentation, you will see
boxes like this describing enhancements I would like to make to Sepp,
and issues relating to its use that I want to investigate more.</p>

<p>At least for now, using Sepp requires a fairly sophisticated
knowledge of computers and file formats. Several packages must be
installed separately to make it work. Unless your data is unusually
consistent and follows Sepp's expectations precisely, you will probably
need to do some analysis of one or more of the file formats Sepp uses
to figure out what is going wrong. You may need to create or modify a
CC table or XSLT stylesheet.</p>

<h1>Output: structure of a SEPP publication</h1>

<h2>Files</h2>

<p>A Sepp electronic Bible consists of a root index.htm file and
a large collection of files in a subdirectory (of the root containing
index.htm) called Conc. Most of these files are generated by Sepp or
provided with it. The
exact set you generate and use depends somewhat on options you choose.
The
files in Conc include:</p>

<p>Files you supply or modify:</p>

<ul>

  <li>HTML files, which you name through the Sepp Options file,
containing the actual scripture text (one file per book), plus
additional material such as
introductions or appendices. The Scripture files may be the original
source for the concordance, or more likely, generated from one of
several alternative sources.</li>

  <li>Introduction.htm, the file which appears in the main pane
of the page when it first loads. You can customize this to give any
sort of introduction you like to your site. It may contain images
(e.g., SABU-ST3 with indigo GBB logo.jpg in the Kupang Malay site),
links to additional introductory material, and so forth, in which case,
those files will typically be in Conc as well.</li>

  <li>treeConc.htm, the default file that appears in the
concordance
(top right) pane initially. It typically instructs the user to open one
of the letters and select a wordform. You may wish to localize it.</li>

  <li>treeText.htm, the default file for the bottom right content
pane
of the concordance. It typically contains instructions to select a
wordform and then an occurrence. You may wish to localize it.</li>

  <li>dummyInner.htm, dummyConc.htm, and dummyText.htm, which are
used
by an alternative (largely obsolete) organization of the concordance.
Most users can omit them.</li>

</ul>

<p>Files you copy but don't normally edit:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Files root.htm, concMain.htm, treeMain.htm,
treeMaster.htm, or indexconc.htm and concMain.htm, which establish the
basic organization of the site
into frames. Each also has a bit of text that appears if the user's
browser doesn't support frames. You may wish to localize this, but few
browsers now don't support frames.</li>

  <li>Navigation.htm, the source for the navigation bar which
appears across the top of the page.</li>

  <li>display.css, the main stylesheet used by the scripture
files and some of the other panes in the page.</li>

  <li>display-ie.css, a stylesheet containing special-case rules
needed for Internet Explorer.</li>

  <li>display-ie6.css, a stylesheet containing special-case rules
needed for IE6 (and possibly previous versions, not yet tested).</li>

  <li>Three gif files (plus.gif, minus.gif, bullet.gif)
containing bullet images used in the tree diagram.</li>

  <li>mktree.js, TextFuncs.js, ConcFuncs.js, Navigation.js,
containing JavaScript code which implements various functions in the
page.</li>

</ul>

<p>Files Sepp generates:</p>

<ul>

  <li>ChapterIndex.htm, a file generated to contain an index of
the books and chapters in scripture and any additional material you
have requested to be included.</li>

  <li>concTreeIndex.htm (or ConcIndexBar.htm), a file generated
to contain a master
index giving access to the wordforms that occur in your Scripture
through a concordance.</li>

  <li>IndexNNN.htm files, a set of generated files which contain
individual wordlists (e.g., for one letter of the alphabet), depending
on options chosen.</li>

  <li>wlNNNN.htm files, a set of generated files each of which
contains a list of occurrences (with a short context for each) of one
wordform that occurs in your text.&nbsp;</li>

</ul>

<p>Additional files for a CD distribution</p>

<ul>

  <li>ConcStartup.exe, a simple program to launch the index.htm
file, install a brower or fonts, or install the package.</li>

  <li>autorun.inf, the 'magic' file that tells the system to
launch ConcStartup.exe when a CD is inserted. It also tells the system
to use Resources\Cloth.ico as the icon for the CD.</li>

  <li>Resources\Fonts can contain any font information you wish.
Files in this folder of type TTF get installed by the install fonts
button.</li>

  <li>Resources\Cloth.ico is the icon for both the CD and the
shortcuts the program makes. You can subsitute your own icon if you
wish. It should have both 32x32 and 16x16 versions.</li>

  <li>Resources\Firefox2.0.0.6 is an installer for Firefox, run
by the install browser button.</li>

  <li>Indonesian.loc is a dummy file. If present, it causes
ConcStartup to use the Indonesian localization even if that is not the
default UI language on the system.</li>

</ul>

<p class="enhancement">Test with other
browsers besides Firefox and Internet Explorer 6 and 7. If possible get
it to work with them too.</p>

<p class="enhancement">Many of the pages generated will
not make sense
isolated from the frameset. I've seen documentation of a technique for
diverting the browser to the proper root file if one of the child pages
is opened independently (e.g., from a google search). It would be nice
to do this.</p>

<p class="enhancement">ConcStartup should be
configurable to use a specified icon and browser installer. The default
target directory could also be configurable.</p>

<p class="enhancement">Localization strings should be
taken from a file to allow localization without recompilaton.</p>

<p class="enhancement">ConcStartup should be
localized into more languages and offer a combo box or similar control
to allow the desired UI language to be chosen.</p>

<h2>Organization into frames (alphaTreeMf index type).</h2>

<p>Sepp supports several different ways of organizing the tree of
wordforms. The current default, used for the Kupang Scriptures, seems
to work best. The frames are initially organized like this:</p>

<ul>

  <li>index.htm</li>

  <ul>

    <li>navigation (Conc\Navigation.htm)</li>

    <li>body (Conc\root.htm)
      <ul>

        <li>index (ChapterIndex.htm)</li>

        <li>main (Introduction.htm)</li>

      </ul>

    </li>

  </ul>

</ul>

<p>Selecting most links in the index pane replaces
Introduction.htm with an alternative file. Clicking the concordance
link replaces root.htm with another file, producing this organization:</p>

<ul>

  <li>index.htm</li>

  <ul>

    <li>navigation (Conc\Navigation.htm)</li>

    <li>body (Conc\treeMaster)
      <ul>

        <li>outer (concTreeIndex.htm)</li>

        <li>concholder (treeMain.htm)
          <ul>

            <li>conc (treeConc.htm)</li>

            <li>main (treeText.htm)</li>

          </ul>

        </li>

      </ul>

    </li>

  </ul>

</ul>

<p>In this organization, the contents of the outer pane will be
replaced with one of the indexNNN.htm files when the user expands one
of the letters of the alphabet. Each of these index files contains an
apparently similar tree diagram with a different letter expanded.</p>

<p>When the user selects a wordform, treeConc.htm (which just
contains
brief instructions) with one of the wlNNNN.htm files containing the
occurrences of that word in a brief line of context.</p>

<p>When the user selects an occurrence, treeText.htm is replaced
with one of the htm files containing a book of Scripture.</p>

<h2>Other organizations</h2>

<p>In the sepp options file, you can select other organizations:</p>

<dl>

  <dt>alphaTree</dt>

  <dd>This similar in appearance (tree of letters which can be
expanded), but
concTreeIndex has all the wordforms and no indexNNN.htm files are
generated. JavaScript is used to expand and collapse items. An
advantage is being able to expand more than one item at a time.
However, loading the tree is much slower, and in IE it stays fully
expanded until you allow the JavaScript to run.</dd>

  <dt>rangeTree</dt>

  <dd>This is currently implemented like alphaTree, though it
would be
possible and better to implement it like alphaTreeMf. Instead of
letters of the alphabet as top-level tree nodes, it uses word ranges.
Breaks between ranges are arbitrarily chosen to make the number of
wordforms in each range (and the number of ranges at the top level)
roughly equal. This organization may be helpful if your language has a
very large alphabet (making the top-level of the alpha tree too large)
or if two many words start with the same letter. Warning: it hasn't
been used for a while, and might be lacking some of the later
enhancements.</dd>

  <dt>twoLevelRange</dt>

  <dd>This organizes the list like rangeTree, but the display is
organized differently. There are two separate vertical columns.
Selecting a range in the first one puts that range of wordforms into
the second one. This version has not been found very useful, and has
not been tried for some time. It requires a somewhat different version
of the frame-organizing files. These may require some adjustment if it
comes back into favor.</dd>

</dl>

<ul>

  <li>index.htm</li>

  <ul>

    <li>navigation (Conc\Navigation.htm)</li>

    <li>body (Conc\indexConc)
      <ul>

        <li>outer (concIndexBar.htm)</li>

        <li>inner (dummyInner.htm)</li>

        <li>concholder (concMain.htm)
          <ul>

            <li>conc (dummyConc.htm)</li>

            <li>main (dummyText.htm)</li>

          </ul>

        </li>

      </ul>

    </li>

  </ul>

</ul>

<p class="enhancement">There are really two orthgonal
variations:
alphabetic versus equal-range subdivision, and two-pane, JavaScript
tree, and multi-file tree presentations. All six options should be
supported, probably with two separate properties controlling them. At
least, the rangeTreeMf option should be supported, for using the
equal-range approach with the (so far most desired) fast tree
presentation.</p>

<h1>Overview of the process</h1>

<p>The basic operation of SEPP, if you are starting from OurWord
files, works like this:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Create a working directory for the process by unzipping the
Sepp package (get it from john_thomson@sil.org for now). For the moment
this working directory MUST be C:\BibleConv.</li>

</ul>

<p class="enhancement">It should be possible to configure
Sepp to use a different working directory.</p>

<p class="enhancement">Sepp should be posted on a web site
somewhere so people can get it directly.</p>

<ul>

  <li>Download and install CPython if you do not already have
it.&nbsp;(***Todo: link.)</li>

  <li>Obtain the DotNet version of the CC DLL, for example, from
FieldWorks or EncConverters (***Todo: links. Or perhaps include this
with instructions how to register it manually?)</li>

  <li>Unzipping Sepp should have created a subdirectory,
C:\BibleConv\OW. Copy your OurWord db files there.</li>

  <li>Edit Sepp C:\BibleConv\Options.xml to configure the way you
want
Sepp to function. Minimally you must list the files you want Sepp to
process and provide some information about each. This is described more
below.</li>

  <li>Runn Sepp. It looks like this:</li>

</ul>

<h1><img style="width: 484px; height: 300px;" alt="Here you should see a picture of the application running" src="SeppScreenshot.JPG"></h1>

<ul>

  <li>Click the OW to USFM button. This creates a set of PTX
files in a directory USFM under your working directory.&nbsp;</li>

  <li>Click the USFM to OSIS button. This creates a set of XML
files in OSIS format in a directory OSIS under your working directory.</li>

  <li>Click the OSIS to HTML button. This creates a set of HTML
files in two directories, an HTML directory, and also in your final
output Conc directory.</li>

  <li>Click the HTML to XHTML button. This creates a set of XHTML
files in a directory ConcInput under your working directory. These
files are the actual input to the concordance-building process.</li>

  <li>(Optional). If you want some or all books to have an
associated introduction, create a folder Intro under your working
directory, put the files there, and modify Sepp Options.xml to indicate
which introduction file goes with which book. These files can be
anything that can be displayed within a web page, for example, HTML,
PDF, or JPG files.</li>

</ul>

<p class="enhancement">Enhance ConcStartup with an option
to install Acrobat reader, for use when introduction or extra files
need it.</p>

<ul>

  <li>(Optional). If you want to add extra information (appears
at the end of the book/chapter index, but is not concorded), create a
folder Extras in your working directory and put the files there. Enter
information about them in the extraFiles section of your Sepp
Options.xml.</li>

  <li>Click Buld chapter index to create the book/chapter index
for your site. It will also copy the files from Intro and Extras to the
output Conc directory.</li>

  <li>Click Build Concordance to generate the remaining output
files in Conc.</li>

  <li>Copy all the files from the supplied FilesToCopyToOutput
directory to the Conc directory. (This is currently done manually.) You
may instead choose one of the localized versions of these files;
currently the only set is FilesToCopyIndonesian.</li>

</ul>

<p class="enhancement">There should be a button to copy
the necessary
FilesToCopyToOutput for the currently selected options to the output
directory. Problem: how then do we handle localized versions?
MaybeFilesToCopyToOutput has subdirectories FilesToCopyToOutput.in etc,
and the program lets you choose? </p>

<ul>

  <li>Move index.htm from the Conc directory to the parent
directory.</li>

</ul>

<p>At this point you should be able to open index.htm and review
your site. Go back and fix any problems. The list control in Sepp
allows you to work with one file at a time (or a few files). Note that
the concordance and chapter index must be generated all-at-once; the
only reason to do this without checking all files is to produce a
demonstration concordance of just a few books. It does NOT work to
modify one or two files and run all the way through the process with
just those files checked. You can do that for the early stages, but the
chapter and concordance indexes must be completely regenerated with all
files selected.</p>

<p>If you want to create a CD there are additional steps:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Make a root directory for your CD. Move index.htm and the
Conc directory there.</li>

  <li>Copy ConcStartup.exe and autorun.inf (and if you wish
Indonesian.loc) to the root.</li>

  <li>Copy the Resources directory to the root.</li>

  <li>Edit the Introduction.htm file to contain whatever you want.</li>

  <li>Download Firefox2.0.0.6.exe and put it in the Resources
folder (***Todo: link).</li>

  <li>Burn a CD with the contents of the folder.</li>

</ul>

If you are making a web site there are just a couple of extra steps:<br>

<ul>

  <li>Edit the Introduction.htm file to contain whatever you want.</li>

  <li>We would like you to include a visit counter in your
introduction.
(***Todo: copy the info about the one Chuck recommended. ***)</li>

  <li>We would appreciate your including a link to the Sepp site
(***Todo: when we have one...)</li>

</ul>

Other, optional things you might do:<br>

<ul>

  <li>Edit the icon (Resources\Cloth.ico).</li>

  <li>Supply different or additional fonts in the Resources\Fonts
folder.</li>

</ul>

<p class="enhancement">The fonts button should be disabled
or hidden in ConcStartup if there
are no fonts to install. Or else it should give an appropriate message.</p>

<ul>

  <li>Edit display.css to adjust the way your Scripture is
formattted.</li>

  <li>Make Scripture references in your book introductions etc.
"hot". The scripture files have anchors of the form CnnVnn for each
verse (even ones in the middle of a bridge!). Scripture is always in a
frame called "main". Thus, a typical hot link would look like this:
&lt;a target="main"
href="Kup-MRK-Final-Qa.htm#C16V1"&gt;16:1-8&lt;/a&gt;.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Different starting points</h2>

<p>It should be possible to start the process at later points,
for example, if your Scripture is already USFM, OSIS, HTML, or even
XHTML. These options have not been tested. Later sections of this
document describe what I know about the various intermediate formats.
If you encounter problems, it may be that I can enhance the program to
help.</p>

<h2>The Sepp Options.xml file</h2>

<p>There are various ways you can configure Sepp, including
providing the text for various strings it embeds in certain output
files. Sketchy documentation is provided as comments in the file itself.</p>

<p>The most important part of the options file is the section
that tells Sepp what files to process and in what order they should
appear in the contents list. A line in the &lt;files&gt;
section typicallly looks like this:</p>

<pre>&lt;file name="Kup-TIT-Final-Qa.xml" abbr="Tit" eng="Tit" parallel="Titus" intro="Kup-TIT-Intro-Q.htm"/&gt;<br></pre>

<p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">name</span>
attribute gives the actual computer name of the file. For historical
reasons, it should always have the extension xml. Sepp will substitute
the appropriate extension when dealing with other kinds of files.</p>

<p class="enhancement">It would be neater not
to require any extension here.</p>

<p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">abbr</span>
attribute is the abbreviation that should appear for this book in
references in the concordance (top right) pane.</p>

<p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">eng</span>
attribute is only for documentation and perhaps to make things easier
for an english speaker setting things up. It is the English
abbreviation of the book.</p>

<p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">parallel</span>
attribute is the version of the book name that occurs in
cross-references. This is used in detecting places where
cross-references can automatically be made "hot."</p>

<p>The optional&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">intro</span>
attribute gives the name of any introduction file that is provided (in
the Info folder) for this book.</p>

<p>If you have extra files and want links to them appended to the
book/chapter index, put entries like this in the
&lt;extraFiles&gt; element:</p>

<p>&lt;file name="Kup-CREED-Final-Q.htm" linkText="Pengakuan
Iman Rasuli"/&gt;</p>

<p>Here <span style="font-style: italic;">name</span>
gives the name of the file and <span style="font-style: italic;">linkText</span>
gives the actual text that should appear in the index.</p>

<h1>XHTML Input</h1>

<p>Starting directly from XHTML has all the complications
discussed below for starting from HTML. In addition, there is the
complication that you will need to manually copy the XHTML files to the
Conc directory. It remains to be seen whether this will work, but I
don't know of any reason why it wouldn't.
</p>

<p class="enhancement">It should be possible to work
entirely with XHTML, not needing an HTML version of the files. Is it?</p>

<h1>HTML to XHTML</h1>

<h2>The HTML input expected</h2>

<p>(Note: you can typically skip this section if your HTML is
generated from one of the earlier stages.)</p>

<p>Here are the key requirements for an HTML file set that Sepp
can process:</p>

<ul>

  <li>The input file must be encoded in UTF8. (***Todo: links to
TecKit and maybe other tools that can help with encoding conversions)</li>

  <li>The Scripture must be organized one book per file.</li>

  <li>At the start of each verse must be an anchor of the form
CNVM, where N is the chapter number and M is the verse number. For
example, &lt;a name="C2V25"/&gt; or &lt;a
name="C12V1"/&gt;</li>

  <li>elements whose contents should not be concorded (for
example, verse numbers, possibly section headings) must have classes,
which are listed in the &lt;excludeClasses&gt; element in Sepp
Options.xml.</li>

  <li>elements whose contents are not canonical should be given
classes and listed in the &lt;specialClasses&gt; element.</li>

  <li>If you want to use display.css unmodified, you need to use
the system of classes for which it was designed. At this point you will
have to be able to read CSS files to figure this out.</li>
</ul>
Here is a typical document header generated by our current system:<br>
<pre>&lt;head&gt;</pre>
<pre>&lt;META http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"&gt;</pre>
<pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="display.css" type="text/css"&gt;&lt;!--[if IE]&gt;</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;link href="display-ie.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /&gt;</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;![endif]--&gt;&lt;!--[if lte IE 6]&gt;</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;link href="display-ie6.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /&gt;</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;![endif]--&gt;&lt;script src="TextFuncs.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</pre>
<pre>&lt;body onload="onLoadBook('Galatia')" class="mainDoc"&gt;<br></pre>
<p>Some important things to note:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To make the selected-word highlighting behavior work requires the TextFuncs.js script</li>
  <li>To make our stylesheets work requires the mainDoc class and the stylesheet links.</li>
  <li>The overide behavior for IE requires the bizarre comments</li>
  <li>The onLoadBook call is needed to get the book name into the Navigation bar.</li>

</ul>

<p>If you want popup footnotes to work, the callers should look
like this:</p>

<pre>&lt;a href="#FNac" onclick="hilite('FNac')"&gt;&lt;span class="crmark"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="crpopup"&gt;Roma 7:15-23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; <br></pre>

<p>The contents of the span with class crpopup (or popup for
non-cross-reference footnotes) is the text that actually pops up.</p>

<p>The onclick is required only to get the behavior of
highlighting the particular footnote when following the link. In
addition, to make this work, the target (the actual footnote) must be
an element in the same document which has the specified value as its ID
attribute; this behavior won't work with footnotes containing anchors
rather than IDs.</p>

<p>Problem: currently, the ChapIndex.htm file is generated from
the OSIS input. You will have to create this by hand if you are not
coming through OSIS.</p>

<p class="enhancement">Give Sepp the ability
to generate a ChapIndex.htm from XHTML using classes to identify
chapter and book names. Another approach would be to allow the book
name and number of chapters to be specified as optional attributes in
the files list.</p>
<p class="enhancement">Test this. One way would be to go back to the WEB bible and see if we can make a concordance out of it.</p>

<h2>The transformation on to XHTML</h2>

<p>Getting from HTML to XHTML uses a little program (included in
the Sepp distribution, but not mine) called tidy. This is simply run on
each input file, with the options "-asxhtml -utf8". You may want to try
running it manually on one or two of your files. It tends to complain
rather verbosely; most of the things it mentions are not problems. Use</p>

<pre>tidy -asxhtml -utf8 -o output.xml input.htm<br></pre>

<p>Put quotes around the file names if they have spaces.
</p>

<p class="enhancement">The program should
detect failure and display whatever error messages tidy generates.
Problem: tidy reports all kinds of things that don't matter. Try to at
least document the most common warnings that can be ignored.</p>

<h1>OSIS input (OSIS to HTML)</h1>
<p>A lot could be said here. The bulk of the work is done by an xsl
stylesheet, osisToHtml.xsl. I am using msxsl, so if you modify this
stylesheet you can use anything msxsl handles. The input is OSIS
(***Todo: insert a link.)</p>
<p>The stylesheet is explicit about the elements it handles. This
somewhat unfortunately means that if your OSIS contains elements it
doesn't know about, it will just leave them out. A careful check is
therefore needed to make sure that nothing (especially large ranges of
verses!) is missing from your output.</p>
<p>OSIS has many variants. This stylesheet is written with various expectations. Some that I know about are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The tree hierarchy is primary; verses hierarchy is indicated with anchors</li>
  <li>Critical information is taken from the <span style="font-style: italic;">sID</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> attributes of &lt;verse&gt; elements</li>
  <li>Elements like &lt;title short="1 Yohanis"/&gt; are necessary to supply the book titles used in the book/chapter index.</li>
  <li>&lt;chapter&gt; elements provide the list of chapters.</li>
</ul>
Note that post-processing follows the stylesheet transformation, to do
some things I could not find a clean way to do in XSLT. These include:<br>
<ul>
  <li>spans with class <span style="font-style: italic;">notemark</span>
containing a single one of the first 20 letters of the alphabet are
converted to the symbols "*", "&dagger;", "&Dagger;", "&sect;" and
various combinations of two of them.</li>
</ul>
<p class="enhancement">The list of sybols should be configurable from Sepp Options, including not doing this.</p>
<ul>
  <li>duplicate anchors are disambiguated by adding a suffix. For
example, if &lt;a name="C16V9"/&gt; occurs twice, as in the Kupang
version of Mark with two endings, the second is converted to&lt;a name="C16V9_1"/&gt;. </li>
  <li>certain elements (starting with "&lt;p
class=\"crossRefNote\"",&nbsp;"&lt;div class=\"parallel\"&gt;", or
&nbsp; "&lt;div class=\"parallelSub\"&gt;") are searched for things
that look like references, and the references converted into hot links.
Something "looks like a reference" if it starts with one of the strings
given in the <span style="font-style: italic;">parallel</span>
attribute of a &lt;file&gt; element, and is followed by appropriate
arrangements of numbers. A single digit is interpreted as a verse in
chapter 1; C:V is chapter/verse; C:V-V links to the first verse in the
range; semi-colon separates references (if the second has no alphabetic
stuff, the book name is taken from the previous one); commas separate
verses in the same chapter.</li>
</ul>
<p class="enhancement">It should be possible to configure the elements that are searched for references to convert.</p>
<p class="enhancement">Ideally it should be smart enough to spot
references embedded in longer text. It would be nice to make hot-links
within ordinary footnotes, for example.</p>
<p class="enhancement">The tricks that are performed after the initial conversion to HTML should be available for use by projects starting with HTML</p>
<p class="enhancement">The program should
detect failure and display whatever error messages msxsl generates. At
least display errors indicating invalid osisToHTML.css file.</p>
<p class="enhancement">It would be better if the stylesheet generated
something really ugly...large, bold, red text, say...for any elements
it does not expect in a particular place.</p>

<p class="enhancement">Possibly the intended
output file should be deleted if a new one is not generated
successfully.</p>

<h1>USFM input (USFM to OSIS)</h1>
<p>I don't know much about this. Nathan's script seems to do a good job
of converting anything I've thrown at it, once I fixed a couple of
minor issues.</p>
<p>(***Todo: &nbsp;link to spec.)
</p>
<p class="enhancement">The program should
detect failure and accumulate a log of the errors and warnings reported
by Nathan's Python script.</p>

<h1>OurWord input</h1>
<p>This is definitely the most dicey part of the input process. I don't
have any specification of the OW format, and it's clearly possible to
insert unexpected stuff. I've kludged something that works for the
Kupang data, but am not sure how well it will work for other projects.
John Duerkson contributed the main CC table which handles the main
conversion.</p>
<p>Most SF markers in OW appear not to be significant unless at start
of line. Many fields must be considered to extend from the marker to
the next start-of-line marker, even if other markers intervene.</p>
<p>It is very easy, where much material (e.g., back translations, notes
not for publication) is being deleted, to end up with a newline that
eventually becomes an unwanted space before a note caller.</p>
<p>The actual process involves a number of steps.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A table deletes end-of-line white space, which often shows up unexpectedly in the output somewhere.</li>
  <li>Fields beginning \bt, \ov, \nt, \al, \e, and \chk2 are deleted
(applying the principle that the fields extend to the next
start-of-line marker). (Otherwise JohnD's table turns them into notes,
and though Nathan's script discards these, we tend to get extra
whitespace, especially before note callers.)</li>
  <li>Two of JohnD's CC tables do the bulk of the work.</li>
  <li>A final cleanup table makes sure there isn't any white space, especially newlines, between text and following publishable notes.</li>
</ul>
JohnD's table marks fields it does not understand by leaving them in
the output but inserting *** before them. This means that the only
indication of a problem is typically these ***\ sequences at start of
line. If you don't look for these they may just make it all the way
through to the final output, which is a problem even if the spurious
field is deleted and that's what you wanted. Therefore, you should look
for such fields and do something about them. Enhancements noted below
would make this easier.
<p class="enhancement">The program should allow additional
CC tables to be applied prior to and possibly after the main conversion.</p>

<p class="enhancement">The program should allow additional
fields to be deleted completely prior to the main conversion.</p>

<p class="enhancement">The program should offer the option
of converting an unknown field to some known field.</p>

<p class="enhancement">The program should report any
occurrences of ***\ at start of line in the output, and suggest dealing with them
using one of the above mechanisms.</p>
<p class="enhancement">Back translation information should be preserved
through the whole process and made available to end users. Optional
parallel columns, maybe?</p>
<h1>Other work needed</h1>
<p class="enhancement">Verse bridges should use non-breaking hyphen
U+2011. In fact, the program should cope with input containing this, a
regular hyphen, or U+2010 (breaking hyphen).</p>
<p class="enhancement">Should support non-Roman ways of detecting sentence endings.</p>
<p class="enhancement">Consider supporting non-Roman ways of finding word breaks.</p>
<p class="enhancement">Consider ways of allowing phrases to be separate entries in the wordforms list.</p>
