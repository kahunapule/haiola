P. Hover window or separate pane for footnotes.
Since Monday report:
Q. Note marker sequence restarts each chapter. Separate sequences for footnotes and xrefs. (xrefs use smaller, lighter letters.
S. Generate complete set of anchors for bridges.

Since Monday evening report
AJ. RandyH says callers are being separated from text again.
AF. Figure way to do alternate style sheet for IE, and use to fix drop caps.
AB. Replace Intro screen and move logo above cloth image.
AE. Make startup application.
AQ. Check that startup has error checking wherever needed.
AP. Make startup localizable and send to Chuck for all translations.
AL. Graphical layout enhancements requested by Chuck.
AM. Add progress bar to startup app.
AN. Create file to make startup run automatically and test
AG.  Copyright (unbold, regular, -2pt) –and add parentheses (?) that ought to be sufficient with the bright red.
AH. Pastel green for \ft popups.
AI. Restore size of cf callers (and remove bold from ft callers)
AJ. CV anchors are not being generated for ranges like 9-10 (single to double digit).
X. Add Creed hot link. Convert DOC to HTML.
AS. 'Install Details' still needs translation
AR. Look at Chuck's TB stylesheet and try to figure out fonts.
AU. Fix alignment in introductions. (And made outline have hotlinks)
----RC1.

AZ. Do something to make it easy to tell the current book. (but: not for introductions yet)
AX. Fix English layout of installer.
AW. Very pale yellow background for left pane.
BA. Icon copied to disk by install so it shows up for shortcuts even after removing the CD.
BB. Fixed missing quote that prevented CREED link working in IE.
BC. Enlarge footnote font to 9 pt.
BD. Add subheadings to non-canonical list.
BE. Fix duplicate anchors generated for subheadings.
BL. Added empty line at end of each book to solve problem where IE does not scroll far enough.

BR. Made footnote backrefs use correct href even if <reference> contents are not right.
BS. Cleaned up problem where footnotes in headings were not handled properly, embedding footnote text in heading.
BT. Got current book display to work in IE(7)
AT. Awaiting Chuck's input...should we warn if font already installed? Should we overwrite?
BH. > 10. The footnote reference markers in the book intros and the Creed 
> are quite different from the footnote reference markers in the 
> scriptures themselves. Any way of making these more consistent 
> (match the scripture pattern)?
BV. Added recommendation to use FireFox.
BJ. Catastrophic problems with IE: v7 crashes, v6 mis-renders with badly overlapping text.
	- override style to prevent footnote popups and watermark. (done, needs testing)
AO. Investigate whether we can do anything to improve failure mode when no DotNet on startup.
Report 22 August (RC3)
BY. In IE, some links purple even though not visited.-- can't fix
CA. Handle \qm for Genesis
CB. Solve not always seeing progress bar for installation and/or add a 'Finished' dialog?
BZ. Navigation bar is not high enough for IE6 or when FF uses larger font size. (Made it bigger, and forbade showing scroll bars.
CC: Force popups not to be bold and centered (which could previously be inherited from caller in section heading).

BI. > 8. The font sizes in the book intros and the Creed are internally

BK. Implement language chooser in startup.
BU. "return to top" button gives error in IE on Vista
BX. Startup green button fails on IE6 machine

Lower priority
M. Make longer chapter lists collapsible.
K. (Optional...tweak sorting, n..ng..ny..o. TBC: sorting of glottal)
AV. Make watermark print
BW. Installer looks a little odd at 120DPI.

ZA. Make Sepp smart about creating missing directories.


Notes on hover window:
- Without DocType, FF underlines popup and won't turn it off, even with text-decoration: none.
- With DocType, IE underlines by default but allows override. But, FF then drops the underline to the baseline.
- Found a technique, involving a comment starting [if IE], for applying different style rules to IE.
- IE always puts note below right of target, even if that causes it to be clipped.
- FF does the same with relative positioning (a a {position: relative;}; span has top, left specified). However its default puts the popup on the far left, which is usually less pretty but always reasonable. Decided to go with this. Nothing seems to make either do consistently reasonable positioning.
- Heading blocks show through in IE (and in FF till I added z-index: 1).

NB: check that adding DocType does not mess up Tidy or concgenerator.

7. Go over JohnW's list again
	- possibly make chapter indexes collapsible
8. Go over emails to Chuck, make list of further questions.
10. Send a new draft (of a subset).
11. Review all FilesToCopy for improved naming and text.
13. Write doc for running program.
14. Change intermediate form to \it...it* rather than using \em.
17. Drop caps don't work in IE .

Possible to do:
- Research printing CD labels. - NA
- enhance program to build complete files
	- copy stuff from FilesToCopy
- Allow root directory to be configured. (partly done, one variable in program)
11. Consider making back-to-verse link in footnotes a superscript. (decided no)

Frame organization:
Initially:
index
	navigation (navigation.htm)
	body (root.htm)
		index: ChapterIndex.htm
		main: Introduction.htm
individual book HTMs go in pane main.
treemaster replaces root:

treemaster.htm:
	outer: concTreeIndex.htm

Notes:
window.open(href, windowname, 'width=400,height=150,location=yes,scrollbars=yes');

try top.frames['framename']

Forcing frames if inner doc opened.
http://www.webreference.com/js/column36/forcing.html

onclick="parent.body.main.location = parent.body.main.location.pathname"
	concholder: treeMain.htm
		conc: treeConc.htm
		main: treeText.htm
wl files replace treeConc.htm in pane conc
book files replace treeText.htm in pane main


window.clipboardData.setData("Text", "some text for the clipboard");
(also getData)

Closest I've gotten is
window.clipboardData.setText('Text',parent.body.main.window.getSelection() + ' copyright')

getting the selection works in FF, not sure in IE.
FF says clipboardData has no properties.
IE says some unspecified object does not support some unspecified function. Apparently clipboardData is specific to IE and getSelection() is specific to FF.

Notes on hacking IE:

Tan Hack:
Any rules starting * html target only IE browsers.
Any rule with property name containing escaped non-hex letter apply uniquely to IE5.

Note need to put IE6 and above in 'standards' mode not quirks mode. Use DocType, don't know how yet.

Commented Backslash hack targets IE5 Mac.

If you want to place the watermark in a specific location on your Web page (say, the middle of the page), add the background-position property to your style to place the image.


On the new ConcStartup:
Implement buttons:
	Browse
	Install
	Fonts
	Browser
	Run
Implement background picture
Localization
