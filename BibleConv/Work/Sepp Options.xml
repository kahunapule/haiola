  <!-- mergeCase="true" means that if both upper and lower case versions of a word occur, they will be merged into the lower case form.
	   wordFormingCharacters is a list of characters that need to be treated as wordforming though they are usually not in Unicode
		maxContext is the maximum length (in utf16 code points) of preceding and following context; longer sentences will be truncated.
		minContext controls how truncation is done: if complete sentence is longer than maxContent, truncate at a word boundary
		if doing so leaves at least minContext utf16 code points, otherwise, break right at maxContext. Note that actual context
		may be less than minContext if the sentence is shorter.
		indexType controls how the main index of the concordance is organized.
			  rangeTree is a tree where the roots are ranges of words, equal in length.
			  alphaTree is a tree where the roots are initial letters of the alphabet.
			  alphaTreeMf is similar in appearance, but only one letter can be open at a time. It uses multiple files and loads much faster.
			  twoLevelRange is a top-level index using equal word ranges, with multiple second-level files for individual words.
			  usfmEncoding is used if the original input is the USFM files, and specifies one of the Python codecs-->
