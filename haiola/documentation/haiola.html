<H1 CLASS="western">Haiola Documentation</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western">What is Haiola?</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Haiola is free and open
source software that assists people in publishing the Holy Bible or
portions thereof in many formats. It converts Scriptures in a source
format to many output formats. The initial source format supported is
Unicode USFM. USFX is also supported. We plan future support for
importing USX files, as well. Currently, Haiola supports one style of
HTML output, plus USFX as an output. In the future, it will support
conversions to multiple styles of HTML, PDF, and formats used by
various Bible study programs and electronic book reader devices and
software.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">What is the status of Haiola?</H2>
<P CLASS="western">This program is under construction. It is a sort
of a partial alpha release, but the parts that are done are useful
and in operational use. We believe that it is better to build
incrementally, and release frequently as new features are added or
other improvements are made. This allows for early feedback as to
what works, what doesn’t work so well, and what would be best to
work on, next. However, this also means that you need to use this
program with due caution. Back up your important data frequently. I
never try to make mistakes, and I test this software on my system,
but I never tried it on your system with your data. This is not
consumer-level software. There aren’t many error traps. Strange
data may cause very strange results, so please watch for error
messages and check your outputs to make sure they look reasonable.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Haiola is a free and open source collection of
programs. It inherits major portions of Prophero and WordSend.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">What is required to run Haiola?</H2>
<P CLASS="western">The following prerequisites must be met to run
Haiola:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">A relatively modern computer running Linux
	and/or Windows.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Above-average computer literacy, including
	knowledge of file systems, files, and the ability to write a batch
	file or shell script.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Knowledge of text encoding, including
	Unicode.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Detailed knowledge of the USFM standard.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Familiarity with some of the electronic
	formats that Scriptures (and books in general) can be distributed
	in.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Familiarity with a plain text editor, like
	Notepad, Gedit, or Kate.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Familiarity with regular expressions.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Familiarity with the command line.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">A reasonably current version of Linux or
	Microsoft Windows. I test with the latest release of Ubuntu Linux
	and with Microsoft Windows 7. It may work with other operating
	systems and versions, but you are on your own with respect to
	testing and using those.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">The latest version of Mono or Microsoft .NET
	run time version 3.5.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Reading this document.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Reread this list. There will be a test,
	later. Seriously, this program has no technical support or help desk
	department, so if you need help with basic knowledge about using a
	computer, including writing a simple batch file or shell script, you
	will need to get that from another source. We can help you after you
	get to that level.</P>
</UL>
<H2 CLASS="western">How does Haiola work?</H2>
<P CLASS="western">Haiola is fundamentally a file format conversion
program. It works with a mandatory directory structure and some
auxiliary files. Rather than doing the traditional thing and
specifying input file locations one by one, using this directory
structure saves a lot of time for both the user and the programmer,
at least when processing large numbers of language projects.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">What is the required directory structure?</H2>
<P CLASS="western">The root of the directory structure can be
anywhere in the file system that you have read and write permissions.
It can be a directory called “BibleConv” in your Documents
directory, on an external device, or on a network drive. You choose
which directory you want to contain your Haiola project data using
the “Set data directory” button. If you are happy with the
default directory (BibleConv in your Documents directory), you need
not change it. I’ll refer to this directory as the BibleConv
directory, but you can name it something else if you like. Under the
BibleConv directory, Haiola will create Work, Site, and
FilesToCopyToOutput directories.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Note that Haiola is designed to work on both Linux
and Microsoft Windows. Most Linux file systems are case sensitive.
Windows is not. Linux uses “/” to separate directories, and
Windows uses “\”. In my examples, I'll use one or the other
style, and leave it to you to adjust when necessary to fit your
operating system.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western">Where did the name “Haiola” come from?</H2>
<P CLASS="western">Haiola is derived from the Hawaiian phrase “ha’i
ola”, which means “preach salvation”. It is really Prophero
with a new user interface and several updates. We left the name
“Prophero” behind because of confusion with a similar product. We
have prior claim to the name, but it wasn’t worth the hassle and
confusion of fighting for it.</P>
