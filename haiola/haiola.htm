<h2>What is Haiola?</h2>

<p>Haiola is free and open
source software that assists people in publishing the Holy Bible or
portions thereof in many formats. It converts Scriptures in a source
format to many output formats. The initial source format supported is
Unicode USFM. USFX is also supported. We plan future support for
importing USX files, as well. Currently, Haiola supports one style of
HTML output, plus USFX as an output. In the future, it will support
conversions to multiple styles of HTML, PDF, and formats used by
various Bible study programs and electronic book reader devices and
software.</p>

<h2>Notice</h2>

<p>You are responsible to make sure that you abide by all applicable
copyright laws and the rules of the applicable Bible translation
agencies when publishing Scripture. More importantly, due care
appropriate to handling God's Word
is your responsibility.</p>

<h2>What is the status of Haiola?</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">This program is under construction.</span>
It does useful things for the authors, and we have reason to believe
that it will do so for you, too, but please <span style="font-weight: bold;">use it at your own risk</span>, and only
with data that you<span style="font-weight: bold;"> back up frequently</span>.
This is a sort
of a partial alpha release, but the parts that are done are useful
and in operational use. We believe that it is better to build
incrementally, and release frequently as new features are added or
other improvements are made. This allows for early feedback as to
what works, what doesn’t work so well, and what would be best to
work on, next. However, this also means that you need to <span style="font-weight: bold;">use this
program with due caution</span>. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Back
up your important data frequently. </span>I
never try to make mistakes, and I test this software on my system,
but I never tried it on your system with your data. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This is not
consumer-level software.</span> There aren’t many error traps. Strange
data will cause very strange results and/or strange messages, so please
watch for error
messages and check your outputs to make sure they look reasonable.<br>
</p>

<p>Haiola is a free and open source collection of
programs. It inherits major portions of Prophero and WordSend.</p>

<h2>What is new in Haiola?</h2>

<p><a href="http://haiola.org/download.htm">See the change log for the
list
of recent changes.</a></p>

<h2>What is required to run Haiola?</h2>

<p>The following prerequisites must be met to run
Haiola:</p>

<ul>

  <li>A relatively modern computer running a
reasonably current version Linux, Mac OS X, and/or Windows. (I only
test with the
most recent version of Ubuntu Linux, Mac OS X Lion, and
Windows 7. Your results may
vary if you use a different operating system.)</li>
  <li>
    <p>Above-average computer literacy, including
knowledge of file systems, files, and the ability to write a batch file
or shell script. It is helpful if you know same simple programming.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Knowledge of text encoding, including Unicode</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Detailed knowledge of the USFM standard</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Familiarity with some of the electronic formats
that Scriptures (and books in general) can be distributed in</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Familiarity with a plain text editor, like
Notepad, Gedit, Kate, UltraEdit, TextWrangler, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Familiarity with regular expressions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Familiarity with the command line of your
operating system<br>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html">latest version of Mono</a> or <a href="http://haiola.org/dotnetfx35.exe">Microsoft .NET run
time version 3.5</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>Scripture input files that are encoding using <a href="http://unicode.org/">Unicode</a> UTF-8 character encoding and
which conform exactly to the <a href="http://ubs-icap.org/usfm">USFM
standard</a>. (It <b>WILL</b> cause problems if these standards are not complied with.)</li>
  <li>
    <p>Reading this document. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This program has no technical support or help desk
department, so if you need help with basic knowledge about using a
computer, including writing a simple batch file or shell script, you
will need to get that from another source. We can help you after you
get to that level.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>How does Haiola work?</h2>

<p>Haiola is a file format conversion
program. It works with a mandatory directory structure and some
auxiliary files. Rather than doing the traditional thing and
specifying input file locations one by one, using this directory
structure saves a lot of time for both the user and the programmer,
at least when processing large numbers of language projects. For each
Bible translation project, you enter some meta-data (information about
the project), then run the conversions on that project or on all
selected projects. Some of the details as to what to do with the
outputs are left up to you, either to process manually or to supply a
script or batch file to process them.<br>
</p>

<h2>How do I install Haiola on Microsoft Windows?</h2>
<p>Method 1: Standard windows install</p>
<ol>
<li>Install prerequisites: <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/Andika_download">SIL Andika Font</a>, <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=Gentium_download">SIL

want to put your data files. Normally, this is in the BibleConv folder
in your Documents folder.</li>
</ol>
<p>Method 2: Portable install (for installation on removable media)</p>
<ol>
<li>Install prerequisites: <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/Andika_download">SIL Andika Font</a>, <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=Gentium_download">SIL
Gentium Plus Font</a>, and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/cc378097">Microsoft
.NET Framework 3.5 SP 1</a> (<a href="http://haiola.org/dotnetfx35.exe">mirrored here</a>) and/or <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html">Mono for
Windows</a>.</li>
<li>Download the Haiola program image, <a href="http://haiola.org/haiola.zip">haiola.zip</a>.</li>
<li>Unzip haiolasetup.zip to the directory you want to run it from (which may be on a portable device).</li>
<li>Optional: create a shortcut to start the program from your menu and/or desktop. (Otherwise, just double-click on haiola.exe or execute it from the command line to start it.)</li>
<li>Run Haiola. On the first run, you will be asked to specify where you
want to put your data files. Normally, this is in the BibleConv folder
in your Documents folder.</li>
</ol>

<h2>How do I install Haiola on OS X?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Install prerequisites: <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/Andika_download">SIL Andika Font</a>, <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/Gentium">SIL Gentium Plus Font</a>, and <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html">Mono for
Mac OS X</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://haiola.org/Haiola.dmg">Download the Haiola Mac OS X disk
image file</a>, open it, and drag the application bundle to your
Application directory.</li>
<li>Run Haiola. On the first run, you will be asked to specify where you
want to put your data files. Normally, this is in the BibleConv folder
in your Documents folder.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How do I install Haiola on Linux?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Install prerequisites: <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/Andika_download">SIL Andika Font</a>, <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/Gentium">SIL Gentium Plus Font</a>, and <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html">Mono for
Linux</a>. (These may be available in your distribution package
management system. For Ubuntu, you can get the latest SIL fonts from
"apt source deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu distro main", where
"distro" is your current distribution (i. e. onieric).)<br>
In other words, in /etc/apt/sources.list, add a line like:
<pre wrap="">deb <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu">http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu</a> distributionName main<br></pre><br>
Then issue the following commands:<br>
<pre>wget -O - <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://packages.sil.org/sil.gpg">http://packages.sil.org/sil.gpg</a> | sudo apt-key add -<br>apt-get install fonts-sil-andika<br>sudo apt-get install fonts-sil-gentium-plus<br>sudo apt-get install mono-complete<br>sudo apt-get install libmono-winforms2.0-cil<br><br></pre></li>
<li><a href="http://haiola.org/haiola.zip">Download
the Haiola distribution
.zip file</a> and unzip it to a suitable location in your file system. Note
that there are several files in the haiola.zip file that haiola.exe
must be able to find for things to work right. The best way to ensure
that is to place them all together in the same directory.</li>
<li>Create start-up scripts or icons to start Haiola with mono. If
you installed Haiola in ~/haiola/, the command to start it would be
"mono ~/haiola/haiola.exe".</li>
<li>Run Haiola. On the first run, you will be asked to specify where you
want to put your data files. Normally, this is in "~/BibleConv".</li>
</ol>

<h2>What is the required directory structure?</h2>

<p>The root of the directory structure can be
anywhere in the file system that you have read and write permissions.
It is normally a directory called “BibleConv” in your Documents
directory, on an external device, or on a network drive. You choose
which directory you want to contain your Haiola project data during
your first run of Haiola, or at any later time using
the “Set data directory” button. Under the
BibleConv directory, Haiola will create Work, Site, and
FilesToCopyToOutput directories.</p>

<p>Note that Haiola is designed to work on multiple operating systems.
Most Linux file systems are case sensitive.
Windows is not. MacOS is normally not case sensitive, but supports case
sensitive file systems, too. Linux and Mac OS use “/” to separate
directories, and
Windows uses “\”. In my examples, I'll use one or the other
style, and leave it to you to adjust when necessary to fit your
operating system.</p>

<p>BibleConv<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; input<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; project folders, normally named by
translation identifier<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Source<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unicode USFM files
for this project<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -or-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; usfx<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USFX
file for import<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -or-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; usx<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USX
files (i. e. an unziped Digital Bible Library bundle)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -and (optional)-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; htmlextras<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Files to copy directly to the html output directory, such as images,
introduction files, etc.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; output<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; epub<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; html<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sql<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; usfm<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; usfx<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wordml<br>
</p>

<p>Of the folders above, the ones you create are the project folders
and ONE of Source, usfx, or usx folder for input under each project
folder. Haiola checks for Source (USFM files) first, then if that
directory doesn't exist, it checks for usfx, then if that doesn't
exist, it checks for usx. You then fill the Source, usfx, or usx folder
with the appropriate input files for
that Bible translation. For example, if you have a Bible translation
(or portion of a translation) for a language with Ethnologue code "abc"
(Ambala Ayta), you would create a folder like
BibleConv/Work/abc/Source/ and then put the USFM files in there. The
USFM files should use Unicode UTF-8 text encoding. </p>

<h2>Including Illustrations</h2>
<p>To include illustrations in lightweight HTML output, include
suitably-sized illustrations in a browser-compatible format (like .jpg). Place these files
in the htmlextras directory. Include the exact case-sensitive file name of those illustrations,
without path information, in the "catalog" or "file name" field of the \fig ...\fig* tag.
Filling in the copyright field is strongly recommended, and required for some illustrations.
The reference and caption, if present, will appear below the illustration on the web page.</p>
<p>If illustrations have a different suffix, i.e. ".jpg" instead of
".TIF" in the htmlextras directory, but the base file name matches, the
extension will automatically be changed in the HTML output. If an
illustration is missing in the htmlextras directory, no &lt;IMG&gt; tag
will be generated. Thus, if you have copyright permission to include
only selected image files, just put those files for which you have
permission in the htmlextras directory for that project.<br>
</p>

<h2>HTML Output Options</h2>

<p>Haiola currently offers 2 options for HTML generation. Concordance
generation can be turned on or off, and 3-panel frame-based navigation
can be turned on or off. See the options on the "Concordance" and
"Frames" tabs of the Haiola user interface. The most-tested HTML output
is with concordance and frames options turned off. Only the option with
both concordance and frames turned off supports sparse books with not
all chapters present. If you turn the frames option on, the navigation
generation fails if the project does not include non-canonical section
titles. Therefore, I recommend that you use either or both of these
options only with projects that have no incomplete books, which have
introduction files, and which have \s section headers in all books.
(These restrictions could be removed in a later version of Haiola if
necessary.) The static concordance option with frame-based navigation
is a slight improvement over the original Prophero HTML output. It
works well on larger screens (not smart phones). This is a stop-gap
option for search capabilities until full text search can be
implemented. Also, please note that when generating concordance files,
the process takes a LONG time, and may appear frozen for several
minutes at a time. The process can be sped up some by deleting the
output html directory before starting. If it already exits, it will be
deleted anyway and replaced. That is why web page elements that you
want to persist between runs must be put in the input/<span style="font-style: italic;">project</span>/htmlextras directory.</p>
<p>Files placed in the input/<span style="font-style: italic;">project</span>/htmlextras
directory and ending in "_Introduction.htm" are used in the
navigational structure of frame-based HTML.</p><p>

</p><h2>What auxiliary files does Haiola use?</h2>

<p>Besides the files in the installation bundle, you provide any
regular expression substitution files to operate on the input files to
convert them to USFM. This is a systematic way to consistently change a
marker that isn't consistent with the USFM standard, or possibly clean
up some encoding issues. By default, fixquotes.re is called, which
turns &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; into typographic quotes, etc. The regular
expression files are UTF-8 text files whose file name must end in
".re". On each line, the first character is taken as a delimiter that
separates the "find" portion from the "replace" portion of the line and
also ends the "replace" portion of the line. For example:</p>

<p>/speeling/spelling/</p>

<p>See fixquotes.re for another example. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression</a>
for more about regular expressions. It is wise to test your regular
expressions to make sure they do what you think they should do before
trusting the transformation.</p>

<p>For HTML output, prophero.css is copied from the project directory,
if it is there, otherwise it is copied from the input directory to the
output/html directory.</p>

<p>On the processes tab, you may specify additional programs or scripts
to run after Haiola does its transformations. Use of these
transformations are optional. I use them to create digital signatures
and zip files of the various output formats, then to copy the output
files to a local image of a file server in the appropriate places for
each project. It is up to you if you want to automate that stuff or
just use a graphical file manager to do all of that.</p>
<p>If you want to present the books of the Bible in other than the
default order, you may now create a bookorder.txt file in a project
input directory that specifies the standard 3-letter abbreviation of
each book to include, one abbreviation per line at the beginning of the
line, in the order the books are to be presented. Abbreviations not
included are omitted from the output, so this can also be used to
generate a subset project (i. e. just the New Testament, or just the
books that have been cleared for publication).</p>
<p></p>
If you want to merge a standard crossreference list to the published
output, you may put a file named xref.xml in the project directory.
This file must be formatted like the crossreferences.xml sample file in
the distribution. The "xlat" entries allow translation of book names or
abbreviations to the local language, and the "xref" entries are the
actual crossreference notes.<br>
<h2>The Books List</h2>

The book abbreviation list is under construction. Its purpose is to
tell Haiola what abbreviations are used for books in crossreferences
and footnotes so that it can construct hyperlinks from those
references. Currently, you must run Haiola on a project first before
you press either of the buttons on the "Books" tab, because in expects
to read which books are in the project from the output USFX file. (This
behavior is subject to change.)<br>

<h2>Command Line Options</h2>

<p>If you specify "haiola -a" (without the quotes) on the command line,
that
is the same as pressing the "Run marked" button on startup, then
closing the program when that run is completed.<br>
</p>

<h2>Who is writing Haiola?</h2>

<p>Haiola uses pieces written by Dave van Grootheest, John Duerkson,
John Thomson, Nathan Miles, Michael Paul Johnson, and possibly some
other people. (Kahunapule) Michael Paul Johnson is currently the only
active programmer working on this project. Haiola inherits open source
code from Onyx, WordSend, and Prophero. (Prophero was called SEPP at
one time, and that name lives on in the source code, too.)<br>
</p>

<h2>Where did the name “Haiola” come from?</h2>

<p>Haiola is derived from the Hawaiian phrase “ha’i
ola”, which means “preach salvation”. It is really Prophero
with a new user interface and several updates. We (mostly) left the
name
“Prophero” behind because of confusion with a similar product. We
have prior claim to the name, but it wasn’t worth the hassle and
confusion of fighting for it.</p>

<h2>Support</h2>

I don't promise support with this program, but I do want it to work for
you. I also want to make this program better. If you have read this
document and still need help, you may send email via a secure web form
at <a href="https://cryptography.org/cgi-bin/contact.cgi">https://cryptography.org/cgi-bin/contact.cgi</a>
with <span style="font-weight: bold;">enough information that I don't
have to guess what the problem is</span>.
Since this document is published on the open Internet, I don't want to
include a plain reference to any of my current email addresses, but if
you concatinate "Michael", the first initial of my last name, the usual
email separator between name and domain, and the domain of the "YWAM"
link, below, that should work. Or, just use the contact URL above.
Remember the part about reading this document first. Also, make sure
you have the most recent version of this program if you have a problem,
just to make sure I haven't already fixed whatever is bugging you.<br>

<br>
