</tr>

 <td>Added XSLT set to convert human-readable internal Scripture references to ref tags.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
 <td>2013-08-29</td>
 <td>Corrected the locale*.conf file output for Sword project input (located in the output/mosis directory).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>2013-08-28</td>
 <td>Added lang attribute to <html> tags. Chrome might still tell me that lots of things are Malay that aren't, but at least it won't be my fault, now. :-)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>2013-08-15</td>
 <td>Moved bottom-of-chapter navigation block to above footnotes in HTML output for better reading ease.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>2013-08-12</td>
 <td>Added checkbox to indicate subset projects (i.e. protestant 66-book Bible extracted from a larger Bible with Deuterocanon/Apocrypha) to make statistics counting more accurate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>2013-08-09</td>
 <td>Made verse processing tolerant of a Unicode RLM (right-to-left marker) character before a dash in a verse bridge. Spares you warning messages-- no real errors would have happened unless you had 2 verse bridges in a row.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>2013-08-08</td>
 <td>Added status tracking checkboxes.
 Added plugin version safety check.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>2013-08-06</td>
 <td>Added basic support for extended footnotes and cross references.

<tr>
 <td>2013-08-05</td>
 <td>Several bug fixes. Enhanced (Modified) OSIS generation for better compatibility with the Sword Project.
 Added support for nested styles in USFM 2.4.
 Changed compilers and setup system builders, so we recommend uninstalling old versions before installing this one or later, as the program gets put in a different place and old files would not be overwritten.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>2013-01-04</td>
 <td>Corrected bug in USFX ve tag placement in USFX files right after b tags. Made \toc2 titles primary for book navigation instead of \h headers, but still fall back to \h.
 Made book name entry totally rely on standard \toc# \h and \mt# tags instead of Haiola state storage so that this information survives a trip into the Digital Bible Library.
 Corrected a navigational bug in the concordance structure (\ where / belonged in a web path).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>2012-12-20</td>
 <td>Corrected some concordance generation and display bugs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>2012-12-15</td>

</tr>

 <td>Corrected some navigation bugs in concordance+frame set HTML generation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>2012-11-28</td>
 <td>Corrected a couple of issues pertaining to MOSIS generation. Merged in more concordance generation tweaks. MOSIS generation now passes all tests except that reference tags are still not generated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>2012-11-22</td>
 <td>Improved concordance generation. Better Modified OSIS generation, but still needs work on reference tags.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>2012-11-02</td>

    <tr>
      <td>2012-10-19<br>
