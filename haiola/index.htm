<h1>Haiola Scripture Publishing Software</h1>

<p>Haiola is the continuation of both the Prophero (SEPP) and WordSend (Onyx) open source Scripture publishing software projects.<br>
</p>
<p>Haiola Scripture publishing software is in alpha test. So is this
documentation. Please use it only at your own risk, and with frequent
backups of your data.</p>

<p>Please remember that in publishing Scripture:</p>

<ul>

  <li>You must do your best to protect the integrity of the Holy Bible
at all
times, because it is God's Word.</li>
  <li>You are responsible to comply with all applicable copyright and
trademark requirements.</li>
  <li>You are responsible to comply with applicable organizational
guidelines concerning translation, checking, and publishing Scripture.</li>
</ul>

<p>The current Haiola documentation assumes that you are very familiar
with computers and file systems. Some knowledge of programming is helpful.</p>
