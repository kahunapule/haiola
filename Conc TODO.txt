Things to do on Concordance
1. Finish getting cross-references to work. (done)
2. Get top-level index file working. (done)
4. Proofread comparing with Chuck's sample (formatting roughly matched, detailed proof-read assigned to Sharon)

18. Make line spacing uniform.
3. Research CD auto-load. (done, not tested)
6. Check in (including FilesToCopy) (of course needs doing again occasionally)
C. Color references in concordance. (Maybe make whole line hot?)
D. Go to top (of Scripture) button somewhere...proposing row of controls at top Kembali ke bagian awal buku.
B. Visit counter (investigated...can't do more till ready to put online)
G. (For web site only. Omit occurrences of pung dia dong sang deng ko beta kasi ju bosong bilang sonde ada su itu bekin ma dari tu jadi pi mau kotong satu lu te) - postpone till web site version
I. Fonts folder on CD, possibly add Font install instructions to opening screen.
J. Increase max context slightly, and make more willing to shorten to word boundary.
N. Verse numbers in body text and references in concordance in dark red.
O. Increase space between back reference and body of notes.

A. Alphabet option for word tree
Since last report:
E. Rework Introduction wording as reaquested in detailed messsage. (and follow-up message)

L. Option to include header and footnote text in concordance (somehow distinguished).
R. Save Doc intro files as HTML and link in that form.
W. Check out odd *** in 2Tim 2:11 (done...but not solved. Awaiting JohnD's comments)
H. Tweak stylesheet for preferred fonts (Gentium/TNR for body, Andika DR AuSIL/Tahoma/Arial for headings...to be confirmed. 12/14 pt for body, 10/12 for notes.
P. Hover window or separate pane for footnotes.
Since Monday report:
Q. Note marker sequence restarts each chapter. Separate sequences for footnotes and xrefs. (xrefs use smaller, lighter letters.
S. Generate complete set of anchors for bridges.
AD. Use * (asterisk or star), † (dagger), ‡ (double dagger),  § (section mark) and doubling for footnotes.
T. Check footnote backrefs to bridges. (yes, a problem...e.g. C27V55-56)
AA. Insert copyright notice (Tahoma, red) after each title block.
AC. Non-canonical stuff should use jud for titles and cat for footnotes.
Y. Solve *** problems (awaiting JohnD's input)
Z. Get \bt etc deletion working right (new version in C# does not seem to work)
Since Monday evening report
AJ. RandyH says callers are being separated from text again.
AF. Figure way to do alternate style sheet for IE, and use to fix drop caps.
AB. Replace Intro screen and move logo above cloth image.
AE. Make startup application.
AQ. Check that startup has error checking wherever needed.
AP. Make startup localizable and send to Chuck for all translations.
AL. Graphical layout enhancements requested by Chuck.
AM. Add progress bar to startup app.
AN. Create file to make startup run automatically and test
AG.  Copyright (unbold, regular, -2pt) –and add parentheses (?) that ought to be sufficient with the bright red.
AH. Pastel green for \ft popups.
AI. Restore size of cf callers (and remove bold from ft callers)
AJ. CV anchors are not being generated for ranges like 9-10 (single to double digit).
X. Add Creed hot link. Convert DOC to HTML.
AS. 'Install Details' still needs translation
AR. Look at Chuck's TB stylesheet and try to figure out fonts.
AU. Fix alignment in introductions. (And made outline have hotlinks)
AF. Make copyright watermark/background.

Important list:
AT. Awaiting Chuck's input...should we warn if font already installed? Should we overwrite?

Lower priority
M. Make longer chapter lists collapsible.
K. (Optional...tweak sorting, n..ng..ny..o. TBC: sorting of glottal)
AO. Investigate whether we can do anything to improve failure mode when no DotNet on startup.
AV. Make watermark print

Notes on hover window:
- Without DocType, FF underlines popup and won't turn it off, even with text-decoration: none.
- With DocType, IE underlines by default but allows override. But, FF then drops the underline to the baseline.
- Found a technique, involving a comment starting [if IE], for applying different style rules to IE.
- IE always puts note below right of target, even if that causes it to be clipped.
- FF does the same with relative positioning (a a {position: relative;}; span has top, left specified). However its default puts the popup on the far left, which is usually less pretty but always reasonable. Decided to go with this. Nothing seems to make either do consistently reasonable positioning.
- Heading blocks show through in IE (and in FF till I added z-index: 1).

NB: check that adding DocType does not mess up Tidy or concgenerator.

7. Go over JohnW's list again
	- possibly make chapter indexes collapsible
8. Go over emails to Chuck, make list of further questions.
10. Send a new draft (of a subset).
11. Review all FilesToCopy for improved naming and text.
13. Write doc for running program.
14. Change intermediate form to \it...it* rather than using \em.
17. Drop caps don't work in IE .

Possible to do:
- Research printing CD labels. - NA
- enhance program to build complete files
	- copy stuff from FilesToCopy
- Allow root directory to be configured. (partly done, one variable in program)
11. Consider making back-to-verse link in footnotes a superscript. (decided no)

Frame organization:
Initially:
index
	navigation (navigation.htm)
	body (root.htm)
		index: ChapterIndex.htm
		main: Introduction.htm
individual book HTMs go in pane main.
treemaster replaces root:

treemaster.htm:
	outer: concTreeIndex.htm

Notes:
window.open(href, windowname, 'width=400,height=150,location=yes,scrollbars=yes');

try top.frames['framename']

Forcing frames if inner doc opened.
http://www.webreference.com/js/column36/forcing.html

onclick="parent.body.main.location = parent.body.main.location.pathname"
	concholder: treeMain.htm
		conc: treeConc.htm
		main: treeText.htm
wl files replace treeConc.htm in pane conc
book files replace treeText.htm in pane main


window.clipboardData.setData("Text", "some text for the clipboard");
(also getData)

Closest I've gotten is
window.clipboardData.setText('Text',parent.body.main.window.getSelection() + ' copyright')

getting the selection works in FF, not sure in IE.
FF says clipboardData has no properties.
IE says some unspecified object does not support some unspecified function. Apparently clipboardData is specific to IE and getSelection() is specific to FF.

Notes on hacking IE:

Tan Hack:
Any rules starting * html target only IE browsers.
Any rule with property name containing escaped non-hex letter apply uniquely to IE5.

Note need to put IE6 and above in 'standards' mode not quirks mode. Use DocType, don't know how yet.

Commented Backslash hack targets IE5 Mac.

If you want to place the watermark in a specific location on your Web page (say, the middle of the page), add the background-position property to your style to place the image.
